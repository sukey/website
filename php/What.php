<h2>What is Sukey?</h2>
<p>Sukey.io is a frontend webapp designed for mobile phones (mainly tested with a Galaxy S2) and a backend collection of python scripts for the human.io platform which faciliate and foster collaboration between protesters by inviting people at the demo who use sukey.io to support each other by completing microtasks (<strong>think amazon Mechanical Turks for protests</strong>).</p>
<p>All this is done while they are at the demonstration but there are also ways in which people can support a demonstration, wherever they are in the world by helping to verify information coming out from the protest by searching and using datasets (e.g. twitter, twitpic, google street view and google maps searches). By participating you can help solve a real need of people on the ground. For example some groups of people will take photos of banners and placards, while some others rate them. Some people will observe which roads have been closed or are slow to travel down and report them as such while will suggest alternative routes.</p>

<h2>Introduction / Theory</h2>

<p>Sukey.io, in concept, is a sequence of Stimulus:Response mappings which have been devised in order to help demonstrators collaborate effectively during a demonstration.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Stimulus0: We find a tweet online which says "there is a kettle forming on Whitehall, OMG, get out of there!"</p>

<p>Response0: We launch a localised (to whitehall's co-ordinates and the immediate locality) micro questionnaire which simply asks: "Is there a Kettle here?" and can you take a photo of it?</p>

<p>Stimulus1: We receive photos and verification of the fact that the kettle is on</p>

<p>Response1: We can then faithfully tweet out a report that the kettle is indeed happening.</p>
